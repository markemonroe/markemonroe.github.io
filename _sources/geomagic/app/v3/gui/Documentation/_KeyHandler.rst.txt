KeyHandler
==============================================================================
Provides access to key events in the graphics window. To use this in a dialog, create one and
call *setKeyHandler(keyHandler)* on the dialog during the formDialog method of your dialog handler.
Key events can be received by subscribing to the *keyPressed(sender, keyData)* and *keyReleased(sender, keyData)* events. 
*Sender* is a reference to the key handler that generated the event.
