LineSelector
==============================================================================
Convenience class to select a line.  Different types of lines can be selected:
 * On CAD models: straight edges
 * On features:  For line or line target features, this is the feature itself.  For higher level features, derived lines can be selected too, such as the center axis of a cylinder, etc.
 * On coordinate systems:  an axis of a coordinate system.  The first point of these lines will be the origin of the coordinate system, and the second point will be unit lengths away from it.
 * On world axes:  a world axis.  The first point of these lines will be the origin, and the second point will be unit lengths away from it.

 LineSelector is implemented using :py:class:`Selector<geomagic.app.v3.gui.selector.Selector>`, where its filter is :py:class:`LineSelectionFilter<geomagic.app.v3.gui.selector.LineSelectionFilter>`.
