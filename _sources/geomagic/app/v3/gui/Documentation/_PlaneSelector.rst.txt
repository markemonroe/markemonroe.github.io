PlaneSelector
==============================================================================
Convenience class to pick a plane.  Different types of planes can be selected:
 * On CAD models: Planar faces
 * On features:  For plane features, this is the feature itself.  For higher level features, derived planes can be selected too, such as the end planes of a cylinder, etc.
 * On coordinate systems:  a principal plane of a coordinate system.  The plane is oriented in such a way that its normal faces the positive direction.
 * On world axes:  a principal plane of the world.  The plane is oriented in such a way that its normal faces the positive direction.
 
PlaneSelector is implemented using :py:class:`Selector<geomagic.app.v3.gui.selector.Selector>`, where its filter is :py:class:`PlaneSelectionFilter<geomagic.app.v3.gui.selector.PlaneSelectionFilter>`.
