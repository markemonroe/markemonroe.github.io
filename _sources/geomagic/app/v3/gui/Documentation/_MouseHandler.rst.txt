MouseHandler
==============================================================================
Provides access to mouse events in the graphics window. To use this in a dialog, create one and
call *setMouseHandler(mouseHandler)* on the dialog during the formDialog method of your dialog handler.
Mouse events can be received by subscribing to the *mousePressed(sender, mouseData)*, *mouseReleased(sender, mouseData)*, and *mouseMoved(sender, mouseData)* events. 
*Sender* is a reference to the mouse handler that generated the event.
