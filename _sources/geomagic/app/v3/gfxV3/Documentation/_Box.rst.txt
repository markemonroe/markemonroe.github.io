Box
==============================================================================
A box.

If the *axis* of the box is set to something other than (0,0,1), the box is rotated
about its center by the smallest rotation that aligns the direction (0,0,1) with its axis.

Boxes support texture maps, but the way the texture is mapped onto the box is somewhat arbitrary, as there is no
canonical mapping.  For more control, :py:class:`VertexObject<VertexObject>` should be used.
