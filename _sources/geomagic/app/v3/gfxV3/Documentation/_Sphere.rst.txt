Sphere
==============================================================================
A sphere.

The *parameterRange* and *textureRange* attributes interpret the sphere as a parameterized surface.
Those ranges can be modified to display only part of the surface.

If interpreted like a globe, the north pole is at coordinate (0,0,1), the south pole is at
coordinate (0,0,-1), and the equator is in the xy plane.

The *x* coordinate of the parameter range describes the longitude,
with x=0 being pointing toward (1,0,0), x=0.25 toward (0,1,0), x=0.5 toward (-1,0,0) and x=0.75 toward (0,-1,0).

The *y* coordinate of the parameter range describes the latitude, with y=0 being the south pole,
y=0.25 being 45 degree south, y=0.5 the equator, up to y=1 at the north pole.

If the *axis* of the sphere is set to something other than (0,0,1), the sphere is rotated
about its center by the smallest rotation that aligns the direction (0,0,1) with its axis,
and the parameter ranges are interpreted accordingly.

If *feature* is set, this class tracks some geometric properties of the :py:class:`Sphere<geomagic.api.v3.swig.Sphere>`.
*center*, *radius* and *axis* are tracked.
Changes in the feature update attributes of this class, but not vice versa.
