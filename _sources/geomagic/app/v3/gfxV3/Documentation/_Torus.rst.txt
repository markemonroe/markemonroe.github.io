Torus
==============================================================================
A torus.

The *parameterRange* and *textureRange* attributes interpret the torus as a parameterized surface.
Those ranges can be modified to display only part of the surface.

The *center* of the torus is explicitly given. For the
interpretation of the parameter ranges, first assume that the axis is aligned with (0,0,1):

The *x* coordinate of the parameter range describes the longitude,
with x=0 pointing toward (1,0,0), x=0.25 toward (0,1,0), x=0.5 toward (-1,0,0) and x=0.75 toward (0,-1,0).

The *y* coordinate of the parameter range describes the position along the inner radius, with
y=0 pointint toward the center, y=0.25 against the axis, y=0.5 toward the outside, y=0.75 along the
axis, and y=1 toward the center again.

If the *axis* of the torus is set to something other than (0,0,1), the cone is rotated
about its base by the smallest rotation that aligns the direction (0,0,1) with its axis,
and the parameter ranges are interpreted accordingly.
