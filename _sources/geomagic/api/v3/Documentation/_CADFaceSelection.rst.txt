CADFaceSelection
==============================================================================
Represents a selection of face IDs in a CAD object. 
This class implements the iterator interface that allows iteration through the selected faces. 
Since IDs of CAD faces in a model can be non-continuous, this object should be used whenever iteration through all model faces is to be performed.
