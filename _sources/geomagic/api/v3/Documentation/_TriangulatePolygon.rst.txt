TriangulatePolygon
==============================================================================
Computes a triangulation from a :py:class:`PolylineSet<PolylineSet>`.
The triangulation is computed in 2D.  For this, the polylines are assumed to be in a plane perpendicular to *normal*.
The *polylineSet* can have multiple loops, including nested loops.  Inner loops need to have the opposing winding as outer loops.
If loops intersect each other or are not closed, the result of the triangulation is undefined.
If new points are added, they are placed on a plane perpendicular to *normal* that contains the centroid of all
points of the polyline set.
