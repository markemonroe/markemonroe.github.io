BestFitDrafted
==============================================================================
Best fits a surface onto a TriangleSelection by projecting points in the selection onto a plane, creating Polylines from the points, fitting a curve (the sketch) onto the Polylines, and extruding the curve outward to create a surface. This
differs from BestFitExtruded in that the sketch can be scaled at a constant rate as it is extruded for a better fit.
