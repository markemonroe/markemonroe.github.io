DataObject
==============================================================================
This is the base class for DataObjects. DataObjects are stored in the Database. They are a container for data. They contain
a table of properties. DataObjects can also be placed into relationships. Normally you would not create this class directly. 
Anything that is in the DataObjects section of help inherits from this class. You cannot add new properties to a DataObject and
you will get a warning telling you that the property does not exist.

   :end-before: # example "geoapi.datamodel.DataObject"
