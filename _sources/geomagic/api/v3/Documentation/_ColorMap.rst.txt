ColorMap
==============================================================================
A color map is a table that defines a map from floating point values to colors.

The table is defined by two parallel arrays: *marks* and *colors*, where *marks* is strictly monotonously increasing.
To map a value *v* to a color, an minimal index *i* is computed such that *v* is not greater than *marks[i]*.
The value *v* is then mapped to *color[i]*.

If *v* is greater than all elements of *marks*, then the last element of *colors* is returned.  Another way to think of think of this
is that the largest element of *marks* is always interpreted as +inf.

Color maps also provide a dedicated color for undefined input.  This property is called *undefinedColor*.
This is useful if the data to be visualized is only partially defined.

Though color maps can be created manually, often the utility :py:class:`CreateColorMapFromTolerance<CreateColorMapFromTolerance>` will be used.

**Examples**


Create a color map that maps positive numbers to green, and others to red.
