Resample
==============================================================================
This is used to clean up points generated by a scanner. The points from a scanner tend to be thin lines with a lot of close points and
space separating the lines. Resample will redistribute the points to form a more regular pattern which will give better 
results when these resampled points are used in other algorithms like reduce noise and wrap.
