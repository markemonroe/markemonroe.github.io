FlipTriangles
==============================================================================
Flips triangles of a mesh.
Closed components of a mesh have a natural orientation, where the outside of
the triangles is seen from far away.  Unless the *lockClosed* attribute is
cleared, these regions will not be flipped, even if they are part of
a selection.
