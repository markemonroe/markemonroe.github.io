IntersectMeshWithPlane
==============================================================================
Intersect a mesh by a plane. Input selection is supported. Output is represented by triangle selection on positive side of the plane, an edge selection containing the boundary of intersection, and a vertex selection, corresponding to open ends of edge selection.
Note that this modifies the mesh by dividing any faces that intersect the plane in two.
