TextureManager
==============================================================================
Data object that contains mesh texture information, like texture coordinates and images.
It can be used for various texture-related queries, as argument for texture-related
operations. Multiple texture managers can be associated with a given mesh, but only one
can have an active status, which is used for rendering. For getting and setting active 
texture manager please refer to :py:class:`GetActiveTextureManager<GetActiveTextureManager>` and
:py:class:`SetActiveTextureManager<SetActiveTextureManager>`.
