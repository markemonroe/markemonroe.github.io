PackMesh
==============================================================================
This modifier optimizes the memory used by a mesh. Normally when deleting points and triangles the positions in the list
of remaining triangles and points are not moved. This can results in the mesh still using the same amount of memory even
if a large portion of the mesh has been deleted. PackMesh remaps the triangles and points to only use the space needed for the
existing points and triangles. After a pack any indices into the mesh you may have previously stored will be invalid.
