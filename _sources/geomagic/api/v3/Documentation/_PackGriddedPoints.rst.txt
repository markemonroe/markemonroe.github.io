PackGriddedPoints
==============================================================================
This modifier optimizes the memory used by a GriddedPoints object. Normally when deleting points in the list,
the positions of remaining points are not moved. This can results in the Points object still using the same amount of memory even
if a large portion of the points have been deleted. PackGriddedPoints remaps the points and normals to only use the space needed for the
existing points. After a pack any indices into the points you may have previously stored will be invalid.
