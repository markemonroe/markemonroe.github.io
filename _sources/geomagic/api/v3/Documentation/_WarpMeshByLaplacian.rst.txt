WarpMeshByLaplacian
==============================================================================
A Laplacian warp of the mesh. This modifier can be used to change the locations of a subset of the
vertices of the mesh, and have the remaining vertices follow along in such a way that transitions
remain smooth, and the original shape of the mesh is preserved as well as possible.

The mesh must not have degenerate triangles, such as those with no area at all, or extreme slivers.
If those triangles are detected, an exception is thrown by *run*.
