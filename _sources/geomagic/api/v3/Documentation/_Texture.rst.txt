Texture
==============================================================================
A color texture map that can be applied to shapes.

For internal reasons, the width and height of a texture is always a power of 2.  If images of different dimensions are
assigned to a texture, they are expanded to the next higher power of two to satisfy this requirement.  The *imageHeight*
and *imageWidth* attributes can be used to query the original dimensions of the image.

Textures support transparency using the alpha channel of colors.  Note that for transparency to be effective, the
material that is assigned to a shape must have alpha values of less than 1.
