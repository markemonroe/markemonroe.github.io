SliceMesh
==============================================================================
Slices a mesh with another mesh.  This is a more efficient way of running a boolean intersection and boolean subtraction independently.

After the operation has finished, the *mesh* will hole the intersection of the objects, and the output attribute *meshSlice* will hold the subtraction.

If there is no intersection between the objects, *mesh* will remain unchanged, and *meshSlice* will be an empty mesh.  If *meshModelAdd* only
partially slices *mesh*, an exception is raised.
