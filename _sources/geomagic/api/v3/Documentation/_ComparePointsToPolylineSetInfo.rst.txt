ComparePointsToPolylineSetInfo
==============================================================================
The result of a :py:class:`ComparePointsToPolylineSet<geomagic.api.v3.swig.ComparePointsToPolylineSet>` run is stored in a ComparePointsToPolylineSetInfo object.
Overall statistics of the comparison are available as attributes.
For each point that was successfully projected onto one of the reference paths, several pieces of information can be queried,
like its index in the original point set, its normal there, and the location, normal and path information of the closest
point to it that was found on a reference path.

It is important to remember that the indices that get passed into these queries range up to *size*.  They are not the
indices of the original points.  To get those, use the method getPointIndex.
