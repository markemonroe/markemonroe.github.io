Points
==============================================================================
Contains a set of points, possibly with normals.

A Points object can have extra properties for each point, such as colors or normals.  Colors can be set freely for each individual point.

Normal vectors represent the local surface normal of the object represented by the point cloud.  The set of normals of a point objects can either be oriented or not oriented.  If the normals are not oriented, they merely represent a vector that is locally normal/perpendicular to the surface of the object, but without a defined direction to distinguish inside and outside.  For a point object that has no normals at all, the CalculateNormals modifier will create non-oriented normals.  Some modifiers are provided to add an orientation to normals: OrientNormals uses a heuristic, and OrientNormalsToView chooses the orientation of each normal based on a given view direction.  FlipNormals can only be applied to objects with oriented normals.

If normals are manually added to a Points object using setNormal or createNormals, they are not oriented. To change this, set the hasOrientedNormals property to True.
