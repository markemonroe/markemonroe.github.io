TargetWarp
==============================================================================
A lattice is superimposed onto an axis-aligned volume.  Each lattice point can be either fixed or movable.
The more points can move, the more flexible the warp is.
The action of the warp is defined by a list of point pairs, which contain current points in space and their desired new position.
A warp will be computed to accommodate the desired movement as good as possible, within the constraints imposed by the fixed lattice points,
and the type of basic function available.

The warp can be of different types: affine, or b-spline.  The affine warp is the most rigid one, as it is described by an affine linear transformation.
The b-spline warp can be further defined using the degree of the splines, and whether they are open or not.

The warp can be limited to certain regions of the volume/lattice.  For this purpose, lattice points can be marked as fixed, which means
that the warp will not move points in that region.
