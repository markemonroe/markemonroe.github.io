Relationship
==============================================================================
Relates :py:class:`DataObjects<DataObject>` together through parent/child relationships. Each relationship has one parent and one
or more children. Events published by :py:class:`DataObjects<DataObject>` that are parents of a relationship will be passed onto
the children of the relationship. One or more :py:class:`Actions<Action>` can be registered with
a relationship. These actions will be triggered based on events published by the parent :py:class:`DataObjects<DataObject>`. 
:py:class:`DataObjects<DataObject>` can be parents of multiple relationships and can also be children of multiple relationships.
