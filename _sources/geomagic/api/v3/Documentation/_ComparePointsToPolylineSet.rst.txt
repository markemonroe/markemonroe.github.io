ComparePointsToPolylineSet
==============================================================================
Compares a reference set of polylines on a mesh and a test points object.
The data of both objects is expected to be in the same plane.
The result is represented as a :py:class:`ComparePointsToPolylineSetInfo<geomagic.api.v3.swig.ComparePointsToPolylineSetInfo>` object.

This modifier is similar to :py:class:`ComparePointsToMesh<geomagic.api.v3.swig.ComparePointsToMesh>`, but it operates in a plane, not in full 3D.
