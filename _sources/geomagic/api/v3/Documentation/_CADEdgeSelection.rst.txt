CADEdgeSelection
==============================================================================
Represents a selection of edge IDs in a CAD object. 
This class implements the iterator interface that allows iteration through the selected edges. 
Since IDs of CAD edges in a model can be non-continuous, this object should be used whenever iteration through all model edges is to be performed.
