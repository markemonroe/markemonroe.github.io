**Examples**


A mesh and its pointcover is created. The pointcover is transformed
by a known transformation and a given plane is transformed with this transformation
as well. :py:class:`AlignUsingFeatures<AlignUsingFeatures>` is activated to align the two planes. The result of this
alignment is an :py:class:`AlignmentConstraint<AlignmentConstraint>` and this is used as an input constraint parameter
for a :py:class:`BestFitAlign<BestFitAlign>` alignment.
