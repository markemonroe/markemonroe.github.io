AlignUsingPointPairs
==============================================================================
Computes a transformation that minimizes the squared distances between corresponding points in two arrays.

The *fixedPoints* and *floatingPoints* must have the same length, and at least 3 points in them.

If the points in both arrays are collinear, the aligning transform is not well defined.
