RegionSet
==============================================================================
A RegionSet is a collection of TriangleSelections on a mesh that come in 3 types: primary, connection, and corner.
A RegionSet is most often created by using the DetectRegions modifier.
Every triangle on the mesh belongs to exactly 1 region with no overlap and no unaccounted for triangles.
